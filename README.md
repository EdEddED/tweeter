# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the code resulting from my studies at Lighthouse Labs. It demonstrates my knowledge regarding HTML documents, DOMs, CSS sheets, JS logic, JQuery and AJAX.

It is also responsive to screen sizes - Desktop users will experience the site in a different manner than cellular and tablet users, but will remain functionally identical.
